It also allows us to plug external frameworks to perform the **selection** of hyperparameters for the individual experiments. As HyperOpt is one of the external frameworks supported by Tune, we could use some Bayesian reasoning in exploring the space. In this way we can incorporate previous knowledge in the process and also actively explore more promising regions of space.\n",
